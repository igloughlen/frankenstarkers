##Sources/Features##

[**Starkers**](https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers)
v4.0 Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme created to act as a starting point for the theme designer. Free of all style, presentational elements, and non-semantic markup, Starkers is the perfect ‘blank slate’ for all your WordPress projects.

[**Bootstrap**](http://getbootstrap.com/)
v3.2.0 The most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

[**Responsive Nav**](http://responsive-nav.com/)
v1.0.32 Responsive Nav is a tiny JavaScript plugin which weighs only ~1KB minified and Gzip’ed, and helps you to create a toggled navigation for small screens. It uses touch events and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also contains a “clever” workaround that makes it possible to transition from height: 0 to height: auto, which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.
